# Humanitarian Helicopter Simulation

This project is a simulation developed in Unity/C# that demonstrates biological processes related to meiosis. Users can observe the stages of meiosis and related events.

## Overview

- **MeiosisManager**: Manages the stages of meiosis including Prophase 1, Metaphase 1, Anaphase 1, Telophase 1, Prophase 2, Metaphase 2, Anaphase 2, and Telophase 2.
- **DialogueManager**: Controls dialogue display and scene transitions based on simulation events.
- **Biological Entities**: Includes DaughterCell, Centriole, and Chromosome objects representing components of the simulation.
- **Event Handling**: Uses C# events for triggering and managing transitions between meiosis phases.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/KalaimaranB/Meiosis_Project.git


2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Navigate to the main scene for simulation viewing.

## How to Use

- Run the simulation in Unity.
- Observe and study the stages of meiosis as they unfold.
- Interact with dialogue prompts to learn more about each phase.
